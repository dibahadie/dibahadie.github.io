I am Diba Hadi Esfangereh, a third-year Computer Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology with a passion for exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. My research interests lie at the intersection of Neurosymbolic AI, Automated Reasoning, Statistical Machine Learning, and Cognitive Science. I am fascinated by the potential of combining neural and symbolic methods to create AI systems capable of complex reasoning and robust learning.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for music, which I express through playing multiple instruments, singing in traditional Persian styles, and studying the art of music generation. This passion has inspired me to explore innovative approaches to Neuro-Symbolic Music Generation, blending symbolic reasoning with deep learning techniques to overcome challenges in this creative domain.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to the advancement of AI systems that are not only technically robust but also capable of reasoning and understanding in ways that align with human cognition.

## Research Interests

My academic pursuits reflect my fascination with cognitive and computational paradigms. Some of my key interests include:

- **Neuro-Symbolic AI**: Combining symbolic reasoning and deep learning architectures to bridge the gap between statistical learning and logical inference
- **System 2 Cognitive Modeling**: Developing computational frameworks that emulate deliberate, logical reasoning processes in artificial intelligence
- **AI for Music Generation**: Exploring novel approaches that integrate music theory with neural networks for creative composition

## Music and Creativity

Music is an integral part of my life. I have a deep appreciation for Persian traditional music and have learned to play instruments like the guitar and piano. I also enjoy singing in traditional Persian style. My curiosity for the language of music has driven me to explore Neuro-Symbolic approaches to Music Generation, overcoming data limitations and advancing creative AI applications.
